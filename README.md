## About The Project

<strong>InventoryProject</strong> is currently in development. It contains a modular inventory system plugin for Unreal Engine (current engine version - 5.6).

System contains:
- Spatial inventory grids and the ability to switch between multiple grids in the inventory to house items of different categories (Equippable, Consumable, and Craftable);
- The ability to switch between grids filled with items;
- An Item Fragment system whereby items can be customized by adding modular "Fragments" to give them functionality (a well-established software pattern in the games industry);
- Items can be different sizes, each taking up a different number of squares in the grid, and items can be stackable, allowing for splitting, combining, consuming, and dropping items;
- Item tooltip popups showing item attributes and the use of design patterns to make a highly-flexible system where tooltips adapt to an item's fragments to display item information;
- Items are functional - not just affecting what we see in the menus, but also what happens in the game.
